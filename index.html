<h1>Reddit post karma trajectories</h1>
<h2>Results from five subreddits</h2>
I am collecting data on the progress of posts through the following subreddits:
<ul>
  <li>The_Donald</li>
  <li>gonewild</li>
  <li>AskReddit</li>
  <li>IAmA</li>
  <li>dataisbeautiful</li>
</ul>

<p>To do this, I wrote 
<a href="https://github.com/slashme/redditlog/blob/master/monitor.py">a python script</a> 
which reads the top 100 posts in each of these subreddits every
two minutes and dumps the results into a sqlite database.</p>
<p>To visualise the results, I then wrote an 
<a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a> script which can select a
sample of these posts and display them in three dimensions - for example by
post age in days, post score (net "karma" - how many times more it's been
upvoted than downvoted) and number of comments. That's all very well, but you
can only really get a feeling for the data if you can rotate the 3D plot.
Fortunately, R also comes with a library called rglwidget (now part of the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgl/vignettes/rgl.html">RGL</a>
library) which can render a 3D plot as a Javascript object.</p>
<p>The 3D objects are a bit heavy in terms of RAM requirements, so I'm not
putting them all on the same page.</p>

<h2>The graphs</h2>
<h3>All the subreddits in one graph</h3>

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:#FFC0CB">—</span> The_Donald &nbsp; <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#FF0000">—</span> gonewild &nbsp; <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#0000FF">—</span> AskReddit &nbsp; <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#000000">—</span> IAmA &nbsp; <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#00FF00">—</span> dataisbeautiful <div id="htmlwidget_container">
<p><a href="allcurves.html">This is an overview chart.</a>
I've plotted all five of the subreddits on one 3D canvas, showing the
relationship between the age of the post in days, the rank or position in its
subreddit, and the net karma score. You can see that posts on The_Donald don't
hang around long before being pushed out by new posts. GoneWild and AskReddit
posts have similar trajectories to each other, lasting about twice as long as
T_D posts. IAmA and dataisbeautiful, on the other hand, have much longer-lived
posts: there's less of a constant stream of new material, so a popular post can
be in the top 100 for about 5 days on dataisbeautiful, or up to 8 days for
IAmA.</p> 
<h3>Comparing in different ways</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold; color:#FFC0CB">—</span> The_Donald &nbsp; <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#FF0000">—</span> gonewild &nbsp; <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#0000FF">—</span> AskReddit</p>
<p><a href="fastthree.html">This compares the fastest three listed subreddits in two ways.</a> 
First I plotted The_Donald, gonewild and AskReddit as before, showing the
relationship between the age of the post in days, the rank or position in its
subreddit, and the net karma score. Here AskReddit and gonewild are quite
similar. Next, I plotted the number of comments instead of the rank, and we see
a very different picture. AskReddit is all about the comments, while T_D and
gonewild are extremely light on discussion, so the second chart very clearly
separates AskReddit from the other two. </p> 
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>I don't think I'm going to make a major project out of this: I started it on
a whim, and I'm not really a data visualisation expert or a web researcher.
I'll keep sucking data from reddit until I have about a week's worth: then I'll
have the luxury of not having a whole bunch of lines starting halfway through
the plot.</p>
<p>If you find this interesting, and you think you can learn from the methods
I've applied, feel free to re-use my code, or grab the database from GitHub and
remix it in interesting ways.</p>
